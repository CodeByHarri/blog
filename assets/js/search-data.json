Well when used in the right conditions this tool can show at which price points the highest volumes of an asset were traded. This can be a proxy for a price entry point. . ... but how will you know if it&#39;s significant? . We can take volume nodes and measure the prominence. The prominence is defined as the vertical distance between the peak and its lowest contour line and could be seen as indicator of how significant a volume node is. Explanation .

The goal of this post is to show the returns of $1000 USD in both portfolios starting the 1st of July 2021. The reason I have not back dated the portfolios to showcase past performance is because ‘would have, should have’. . Methadology . The HIGH-RISK-HIGH-REWARD (HRHR) portfolio contains 6 cryptocurrencies I’ve personally researched and look to have promising value additions in the space (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE). The index equally splits the capital between the 6 cryptocurrencies and redistribute every 6 months on the 1st of January and 1st of July. The GIANT-CAP portfolio contains 20% Bitcoin, 40% Ethereum and 40% Cardano as a benchmark to compare the returns of the HRHR portfolio. The same redistribution logic applies to this portfolio on the same dates. . Risk . My hypothesis is over a span of 5-10 years the HRHR, portfolio will show signficantly better risk adjusted returns than the GIANT-CAP portfolio.

Similarly to the previous plot, the following plot shows the ROI if you had invested 1, 2 and 3 years ago to that date. For example the ROI of BTC on January 1st 2020 would have been 100% if you had deployed capital 1 year ago and almost -90% if you had deployed capital 2 years ago. The idea of this illustration is show that ROIs over 3 years tend to be more positive. This also highlights the importance of dollar cost averaging over lump sum investments. .
